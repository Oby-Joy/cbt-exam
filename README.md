# cbt-exam
A computer-based exam for a police academy. 

This web app has three sections: admin, coordinator, staff, and student. 
The admin's functions are as follows: Admin can add new students, can add new staff members, can assign courses to lecturers. 
The coordinator can view students' profiles and course assignments, can approve exams (an exam would not open if it is not approved), and view exam scores. 
The staff can add questions and answers... This project was built with html, css, bootstrap, jquery, and Laravel.
